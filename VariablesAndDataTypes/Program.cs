            // Declare a char variable named initial and initialize it with the first letter of your name.

            // Your code here


            // Task 3: Type Conversion
            // Convert the double height to an int. Store this in a new int variable named heightInCm.
            // Convert the int age to a string. Store this in a new string variable named ageAsString.
            // Your code here


            // Task 4: Arithmetic Operations
            // Calculate the sum of your age and heightInCm. Store the result in a new int variable named sum.
            // Calculate the product of your age and height. Store the result in a new double variable named product.
            // Your code here


            // Task 5: Display Calculations
            // Display the results of the calculations along with a description (e.g., "The sum of my age and height in cm is: [sum]").
